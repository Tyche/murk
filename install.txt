=== How to Install

(1) Unpack the release.

  * On Linux, Msys2, or Cygwin	
    type 'tar xzvf murk++-2.0.tar.gz' 

  * On Windows you can use Winzip, WinRar or 7-zip to unpack the files.
    
(2) Compile the mud:

  * For Linux, Msys2 and Cygwin - type 'make'.   
    - You will need to edit the makefile to make sure the EXE suffix parameter 
      is set correctly for Cygwin and Msys2. 

  * For FreeBSD - type 'gmake'.

  * For Windows using Embarcadero C++ - ensure the compiler is in your path, 
    then type 'make -f Makefile.emb'.

  * For Windows using Microsoft Visual C - ensure your Visual C bin directory
    is in your path and your INCLUDE and LIB environment variables are setup
    correctly.
    - With Visual C++ Community edition you may use x64 Native tools Command prompt 
      that calls vsvars64.bat
    then type 'nmake -f makefile.vc15'
    - To link with debugging information type 'set DEBUG=1' and then use
      'nmake -f makefile.vc15'
      
  
(3) Create the database
   * Use one of the following depending on your OS and compiler.
     'make database'
     'gmake database'
     'nmake -f makefile.vc database'
     'make -f makefile.emb database'
 
(4) Start the game:

   * For Linux, FreeBSD or Cygwin
	   ./startup &
     If you do not have csh or tcsh shells installed you can use the bash script
       ./startup.bash &
	
   * For Windows
        startup.cmd

(5) Telnet into the game.  The default port in the startup batch files is 4000.

    telnet localhost 4000

(6) There is an immortal character named 'One' with a password of 'potrzebie'
    You can 'advance' new characters to immortal levels with the user 'One'.
    Later you should delete the 'One' character or change its password.

(7) If you haven't already done so, read 'license.diku', 'license.merc', 
   'license.crypt' and 'license.murk++'.
